<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### A little Demo

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ub6cY8s6PK0/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ub6cY8s6PK0)

A 3D Tile map Package helps developers create levels easily in 3d projects. Allowing developers to place objects or "
Tiles" in scene view just by clicking, introducing fully 3d tile map support from gizmo visualization to multiple floor
support.

Here's why:

* unfortunately unity doesn't support tile mapping for 3D projects yet
* it's really hard for developers to make level prototype contain game-play that can be immediately tested
* helping developers to focus more on game-play and game's content instead of wasting time organizing thousand of pieces
  to create levels .
